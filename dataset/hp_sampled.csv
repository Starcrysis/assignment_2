Character,Sentence
harry,I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
hermione,It's so good to see you.
harry,Professor.
dumbledore,Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
hermione,Not in the restricted section...
harry,"All right there, Ron?"
harry,But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
harry,"Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown Gringotts goblins while acknowledging the breach, insist nothing was taken."
hermione,"You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear..."
hermione,Of course! Here it is! 
harry,Yes.
hermione,"Ron, look!"
harry,First year's students will require three sets of plain work robes one wand.
hermione,All the teachers are.
snape,Go on.
hermione,"Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me."
hermione,You two better change into robes.
harry,Will I have to wear that too?
harry,"Yes, Aunt Petunia."
harry,"Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!"
harry,Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!
dumbledore,Gryffindor wins the House Cup!
harry,Hermione! Where are you?!
harry,For me?
hermione,Are you sure that's a real spell?
harry,"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
dumbledore,Another year gone. 
hermione,"Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks."
hermione,Harry?
hermione,"You will be able to, won't you?"
snape,"I assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me... "
hermione,"This is a Time-Turner, Harry."
hermione,Ron!
hermione,"Mind you, it would be difficult."
snape,the both of you would be on the train home tonight.
harry,Goodbye.
snape,Pity.
hermione,Is that...a dragon?
dumbledore,"Afterall, How could you?"
dumbledore,Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
hermione,It was standing on a trap door. 
hermione,No idea.
harry,Great. Now he's coming for us.
hermione, And with Dumbledore gone
harry,That explains the blood.
harry,He was innocent.
harry,Hermione?
harry,Nick got the full blast of it.
snape,"Good luck today, Potter. "
harry,No!
snape,Read it.
harry,Just knocked out. 
harry,My dad will come.
snape,"That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger."
harry,She died in a bathroom?
harry,Of course.
hermione,There must be 1000 keys up there!
hermione,"Enemies of the Heir, beware."
harry,"Who was it, Myrtle?"
hermione,You can talk to snakes.
dumbledore,Yes...and no. 
harry,I never touched Mrs. Norris.
hermione,This is Devil's Snare. 
harry,There's something you've got to see. 
hermione,They got in on pure talent.
hermione,"How fast is it, Harry?"
hermione,He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.
harry,"Ron! Ron, wait!"
harry,I can't be.
harry,Fawkes?
harry,"Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. "
harry,"You know, Hagrid. "
harry,What were you doing down there then?
hermione,"Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there?"
harry,There's the door.
hermione,"You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"
harry,Didn't you hear it?
harry,"When he does, I'm gonna kill him!"
harry,Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that…
harry,"They're not birds, they're keys. "
dumbledore,Yes.
hermione,"No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky."
hermione,An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
dumbledore,"First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher."
snape,Your moment has come at last.
harry,Never try to save my life again.
harry,"Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you."
harry,Floo powder?
dumbledore,"I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
harry,This way.
harry,What do I do with it?
dumbledore,It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
harry,They're gonna kill him?
hermione,Harry. Hagrid.
harry,That someone made the dementors go away.
harry,And now we wait.
harry,I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.
hermione,This is bad.
harry,But I'm not.
harry,Hair!
harry,Yeah.
harry,I'm not hungry.
harry,Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.
harry,"Stop it, Dobby!"
harry,I bet loads of people here can do it.
harry,You're wrong.
hermione,I don't like this. 
hermione,"And all this time, you've been his friend."
dumbledore,I believe we want our gamekeeper back.
harry,What happened?
harry,"Hello, can you hear me?"
harry,They think it's Hagrid.
harry,Once. But so what?
harry,What are you talking about?
dumbledore,And in the meantime I strongly recommend caution to all.
harry,What?
harry,Can I borrow this? Thanks.
harry,Come on.
dumbledore,"Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. "
harry,Follow the spiders.
harry,It'll just be me and him.
harry,"You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain..."
harry,"Oh, umm..."
dumbledore,But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
hermione,I've already got mine.
snape,Mr. Potter.
harry,I know what he is.
dumbledore,I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
hermione,Harry.
harry,Crabbe and Goyle.
harry,Nicholas Flamel?
harry,Don't worry.
harry,"All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
harry,"Well, it is."
hermione,Which means it wasn't there by accident. 
harry,Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
hermione,And then?
hermione,"Oh, move over! "
snape,Supposed to be your area of expertise.
harry,No. Not at all.
harry,Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
hermione, What is it?
hermione,No. It's worse.
harry,"Oh, sorry sir. I’m Harry, sir, Harry Potter."
hermione,Egyptians used to worship cats.
harry,Does that make sense?
harry,Spare bit of parchment.
hermione,You go on without me.
dumbledore,Over there.
hermione,"Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
hermione,You're gonna need your strength today.
hermione,We're not meant to start that for weeks.
hermione,"Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject."
snape,After you.
snape,Do I detect a flicker of fear?
hermione,The Polyjuice Potion.
dumbledore,"Determination, resourcefulness and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules."
harry,"No, sir."
snape,"Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?"
hermione,Bombarda!
hermione,It can't be Hagrid.
harry,"I mean, look at his family."
dumbledore,"I'm afraid they are, Tom."
harry,But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
dumbledore,Hagriiid!! Relax.
dumbledore,And all the strawberries.
harry,It's moving.
harry,Malfoy.
harry,Stand there. There. 
hermione,"Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy."
hermione,It's guarding something.
hermione,"It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. "
harry,"Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
harry,Whoa! Oh. Ahh!
harry,No. Nothing.
harry,He will come.
hermione, Dumbledore! 
harry,Sorry.
hermione,"No one blames you, Harry."
harry,"Maybe Ron's right, Hermione."
hermione,Follow me!
harry,"Now, come on!"
harry,Come with us now. Come on.
hermione,Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future.
hermione,"It's a bit strange, isn't it?"
hermione,I'd probably be dead.
harry,I found him!
hermione,A boy named Neville's lost one
harry,Where are we? A graveyard.
hermione,"But they'll catch Black, won't they?"
harry,"I was lost, I..."
snape,that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
harry,The Sorcerer's Stone.
harry,You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
harry,"Hey, give it back! It's mine!"
dumbledore,"Love, Harry, love. "
harry,What?
snape,"Malfoy, perhaps?"
harry,A woman screaming.
harry,Let's go!
snape,To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own completely undetected?
harry,"Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine."
hermione,I know.
harry,Thanks.
hermione,"Oh, no. Okay, relax."
snape,"He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle."
harry,It's just...
harry,"Yes, there is."
harry,Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
harry,What's happening?
dumbledore,"It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom."
harry,Spiders flee before it.
harry,I've got presents?
harry,It's Quidditch tomorrow.
hermione,It just can't be.
hermione,I think you owe someone an apology.
harry,The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
harry,Mr. Weasley.
harry,It's great to see you too.
harry,It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
hermione,"Okay, bye."
harry,We have to move its paw.
harry,"Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
harry,He's going to sacrifice himself!
harry,I've won the house cup.
harry,And then again just...
hermione,A month.
harry,Malfoy. He called Hermione...
harry,"Yeah, sure."
harry,Look.
hermione,I've got it all worked out.
harry,I think so. 
dumbledore,Good luck.
harry,"You've got to help me, Tom."
hermione,Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.
harry,"Good night, professor."
hermione,I got this off her robes.
harry,What was that?
harry,Ron! You've got to see this! 
hermione,We've got to do something!
harry,What are you all doing here?
dumbledore,Fine. They're both just fine.
harry,What was that thing that came?
harry,"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
hermione,Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?
harry,Who knows. 
hermione,Nobody else knows our password.
harry,This way.
dumbledore,"It's not really goodbye, after all."
harry,You're the reason they're dead!
harry,He'll conjure the Patronus.
hermione,"Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs and put on their uniforms."
dumbledore,He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. 
hermione,Of course.
hermione,Professor I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.
harry,"Hey, man."
snape,"It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best."
harry,"I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don’t exist."
dumbledore,Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.
hermione,That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
dumbledore,The good and the bad.
hermione,I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.
harry,"What is it, Fang?"
harry,"If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
harry,Buckbeak. Okay?
dumbledore,"Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous."
hermione,Add the hairs.
hermione,I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. 
harry,Really? I meant the match. Who won?
hermione,It means you'll never die.
harry,Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
harry,I don't think so. 
snape,"Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter."
harry,"After that, the dementors can have you."
dumbledore,Only this time he chose to act through somebody else by means of this.
harry,Hello. W-what did I do?
harry,Hagrid's my friend.
hermione,And you are...?
snape,Really? Open it.
hermione,Finite Incantatem!
harry,Ron. Ron.
hermione,Did you know?
dumbledore,"However, recent events must be taken into account. "
dumbledore,"For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own."
dumbledore,"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. "
hermione,Wingardium Leviosa.
hermione,He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?
harry,It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me!
harry,Apparently not.
harry,Phoenix tears have healing powers.
harry,"I swear, I don't know!"
hermione,"We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?"
hermione,That's what's under the trapdoor...
harry,"The stranger, though, you and he must have talked."
harry,"Oh, brilliant."
harry,Do you...?
harry,Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.
hermione,How can you be nearly headless?
harry,We still sound like ourselves.
harry,Did you hear about Hermione?
harry,Because I asked it to.
dumbledore,I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.
harry,Professor I swear I didn't.
harry,What are you doing?
harry,I was sleepwalking.
snape,Do you have any idea how serious this is?
hermione," I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable."
snape,How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
dumbledore,And about time too.
hermione,Help! Help!
harry,Hedwig.
snape,As it is...
hermione,Harry!
hermione,"Ouch, Ron. That was my foot."
snape,You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
harry,We need you.
harry,And who owned that wand?
harry,And why did you want to meet me?
hermione,Do what I say. Trust me. 
harry,Lumos... MAXIMA!
harry,I can't believe it's him but if he did set the monster loose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.
harry,Any minute now.
harry,We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
harry,Hagrid.
harry,"I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it."
harry,he Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
harry,Fine. See you later.
harry,To ask you how you died.
harry,Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
harry,Please be quiet! 
snape,Potter.
hermione,"Oh, are you doing magic?"
harry,Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
harry,Don't you see? We had it wrong. 
harry,You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
hermione,"Stop, stop, stop."
dumbledore,"Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy."
hermione,"He's not relaxing, is he?"
hermione,No! I trusted you!
snape,"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy."
harry,Professor Trelawney...
harry,What's that for?
harry,And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
harry,Blown up?
hermione,"Harry, you do realize what tree this is?"
harry,You wish.
dumbledore,"Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why?"
harry,Hagrid!
dumbledore,Very good.
harry,"I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor."
harry,I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...I lost control.
harry," I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight."
harry,"Hagrid, are you okay?"
harry,"Give me my wand, Tom."
harry,What just happened?
dumbledore,Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. 
dumbledore,"That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again."
hermione,Maybe.
harry,I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
dumbledore,"Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you."
harry,Just like that? How?
harry,That's what Snape wants.
dumbledore,Their tears have healing powers.
harry,I hope he finds me.
harry,We think Snape's trying to steal it.
harry,You need to sound more like Crabbe.
dumbledore,"Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. "
hermione,Ahhh! Help!
hermione,To the Shrieking Shack?
dumbledore,Harry?
hermione,Boggarts are shape-shifters.
hermione,At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.
hermione,Blood?
harry,"Alive, you're free."
harry,What are you talking about?
harry,Expecto Patronum!
harry,Let go of me!
dumbledore," Everyone will please, not panic. "
hermione,Nearly headless?
hermione,"If you don't, it will only kill you faster."
harry,"With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. "
dumbledore,The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.
harry,"Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?"
harry,Hello?
harry,Ron's right...I have to go on.
hermione,Buckbeak.
harry,"What do you mean, she won't wake?"
dumbledore,I see.
harry,I was thinking of him. And Mum.
harry,Use it well.
hermione,That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. 
hermione," You don't use your eyes, do you? "
dumbledore,"Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic "
hermione,and it'll be dangerous.
harry,"Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. "
dumbledore,It was because of your mother. 
harry,But you're innocent.
harry,Yeah. Him I've heard of.
harry,Because there's no post on Sundays?
harry,Where's Professor Lupin?
harry,"Dobby, get back here!"
harry,Egypt. What's it like?
harry,"I mean, do you talk to people often?"
harry,Brilliant! Where did you get it?
harry,Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.
harry,My body's gone!
hermione,"For all we know, you could be."
harry,Voldemort killed my parents.
hermione,"The staircases change, remember?"
harry,It's just what I saw.
hermione,What happens now?
harry,And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business.
harry,"But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
dumbledore,"The rest of you, to the Great Hall."
dumbledore,"Exactly, Harry. Exactly."
harry,I don't know.
hermione,Immobulus!
harry,"Hey, he's gone!"
harry,"Ginny, you need to get yourself out."
harry,Whoa! Whooa!
harry,"Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up."
harry,That's Dudley's old uniform.
harry,"And you framed him, didn't you?"
harry,I'll see you back in the common room.
harry,"You're from Burma, aren't you?"
hermione,This came with it.
harry,...watching people press their ugly faces in on you.
harry,Oh. Of course!
hermione,That was so scary.
harry,Come on.
hermione,Even they aren't that thick.
hermione,Do you mind me trying?
snape,Turn to page 394.
snape,What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
hermione,Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital.
snape, Good afternoon. 
harry,Famous fire eaters...
hermione,"Besides, youre saying it wrong. "
harry,Let go of me!
harry,Lumos Maxima...
harry,Let's go.
dumbledore,One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things should find their way into innocent hands.
harry,It was you. 
harry,Sorry.
harry,I said we'd take you to the castle.
harry,Why don't we just set him free?
harry, Shh!
harry,Mischief managed.
harry,"Hey, Hagrid."
harry,Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
dumbledore,and then they are reborn from the ashes.
harry,That's horrible.
harry,Can you tell me?
hermione,Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
harry,"Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?"
harry,"No, thank you. Minister?"
harry,"Happy Christmas, Ron. "
dumbledore,"Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. "
harry,"Ron, I should tell you most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."
snape,I'll get rid of it for you.
hermione,I heard him.
harry,"What's in there, Hagrid?"
dumbledore,"Mysterious thing, time."
snape,What about Potter?
harry,Strange?
snape,"As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it."
hermione,"Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. "
harry,But why?
harry,Wait a minute.
harry,But he's weak. 
hermione,How could I be so stupid? 
harry,Come on.
hermione,We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
harry,At least we can tell him what we know.
harry,You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
harry,"Stop, Dobby!"
snape,When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
harry,What is it?
hermione,No one knows.
hermione,How are you feeling?
harry,But she’s bored! 
hermione,"Well, it's not very good, is it?"
harry,Get us in the air.
harry,"I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything."
hermione,We're forgetting one thing. 
snape,"Don't move, Potter."
snape,"You two, quarrelling like an old married couple."
harry,How did he escape?
harry,"Brilliant, professor."
harry,"Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?"
snape,Asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of the Living Dead.
harry,That's what the dog's guarding. 
harry,"Thanks, Myrtle."
harry,I'm...
hermione,You're dying both of you.
hermione,Lumus Solem!
harry,He told me so the first time I met him.
harry,Tom. Tom Riddle.
harry,Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?
harry,Are you going somewhere?
harry,I don't know. 
snape,Quiet.
harry,RON! 
dumbledore,"She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. "
harry,Wait a minute.
snape,"Come back here, Potter!"
harry,There was no name. 
harry,"Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?"
dumbledore,Which makes you different from Voldemort.
hermione,"You go, I'll stay."
dumbledore,"Minister, I really think I should sign as well."
snape,Silence.
harry,And they found it.
hermione,But it's tricky. 
harry,I'll go first. 
hermione,Professor? Professor Lupin?
harry,That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.
hermione,Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules...
hermione,Pathetic!
harry,It's a snake.
harry,You could teach me.
hermione,We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
harry,"Professor, can I ask you something?"
hermione,Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
hermione,Harry!
harry, Ew. Troll bogies.
harry,Move!
snape,"That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?"
harry,Okay.
hermione,Come and get the nice dead ferret.
hermione,"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."
hermione,"It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."
hermione,According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
dumbledore,Mm. Alas. Earwax.
harry,"""Tom Marvolo Riddle."""
harry,He's living off the unicorns. 
dumbledore,"I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. "
dumbledore,SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!
hermione,Is that bad?
harry,She's not...?
dumbledore,That's ling you see over there...
hermione,Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
hermione,Yeah?
dumbledore,"Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. "
harry,Sorry about him.
harry,Yeah.
harry,What?
harry,You're doomed.
hermione,This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
dumbledore,"In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points"
hermione,Voice? What voice?
harry,We've missed it.
harry,It's locked!
harry,Harry Potter?
harry,"Wake up, wake up."
harry,Here they come. I'd better hurry.
dumbledore,And I have a few last minute points to award. 
harry,"Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't..."
harry,Up! Up!
snape,Vengeance is sweet.
harry,Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
harry,15th Century Fiends...Flamel...
dumbledore,"A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen."
hermione,"Friendship, and bravery. "
harry,A woman.
hermione,Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
dumbledore,And second I sense that something is troubling you.
harry,"Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead."
harry,"Dear Mr. Potter,"
hermione,I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
hermione, But why would anyone go near that dog?
hermione,Ron. Ron!
dumbledore,"Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid."
hermione,"I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something."
harry,Hermione! 
harry,There's another.
harry,"If something bad happens, get yourselves out…"
harry,Get off!
harry,You knew? 
harry,if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
harry,Good job.
harry,Are you a ghost?
dumbledore,Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
harry,Who’s plotting them?
harry,You betrayed my parents.
harry,Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?
dumbledore,All right.
harry,that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
harry,My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.
harry,He'll know what to do.
dumbledore,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it."
hermione,"Simple, but powerful."
harry,"I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks."
harry,"Hey, hey, hey!"
snape,Turn out your pockets.
harry,When I said I wasn't hungry.
harry,"When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'."
hermione,"Okay, go, Harry. Go!"
hermione,We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
harry,The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
dumbledore,This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. 
hermione,Are you okay?
harry,"Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
harry,This is not normal.
harry,"All students must be equipped with one standard size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat or a toad."
snape,You were seen by no less than seven Muggles.
harry,Seeing their faces.
harry,Who is that? That man.
harry,I- I was just—
harry,How can it? 
dumbledore,And between you and me thats saying something.
harry,"But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
dumbledore,It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
harry,You knew all along and you never told me?
dumbledore,I trust by now you realize what it does. 
harry,Never!
harry,Mr. Malfoy.
hermione,I've read all about them. 
snape,"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell."
harry,"Excuse me, who are you?"
harry,"Up! Ron, mind that tree!"
harry,"I can’t let you out, Hedwig. "
harry,Hermione that's the he betrayed my parents.
dumbledore,All right. It'll be all right.
harry,I've got Dumbledore!
harry,"The state of things, sir?"
hermione,Tah- tah- tah- dah! Isn't he beautiful?
harry,Go on!
harry,Sir? I wonder if I could have that?
hermione,Someone like me.
hermione,Professor R.J. Lupin.
harry,Are you mad?
dumbledore,"Quite remarkable, yes."
harry,"Come on, then. Let's go lower."
harry, What did he look like?
harry,"Sirius Black, you mean?"
harry,I don't even know if it's real.
hermione,There are more important things. 
harry,It's about...the Sorcerer's Stone.
harry,They were talking to me.
harry,50?!
hermione,"Furthermore, The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind."
hermione,"You're a great wizard, you really are."
dumbledore,"You both realize, of course that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules."
hermione,Come on. And we can't be seen.
hermione,and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.
harry,What's this?
harry,Dobby.
harry,"He killed my parents, didn't he?"
harry,Thank you. Bye.
snape,"Where, Mr Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?"
harry,I'm just telling you what I saw.
harry,Raids?
dumbledore,"But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light."
harry,Get us out of here.
harry,How did he find out?
harry,You heard what Hagrid said.
dumbledore,Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
dumbledore,"Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. "
harry,You were there. You heard me.
harry,Resigned? Why?
hermione,Seems to be. Why?
hermione,Look at my face.
hermione,I've read about those.
harry,Now you’ve done it.
harry,Who is it?
harry,She's cold as ice.
hermione,It's also quite dangerous. 
hermione,"I mean, everyone's looking for him."
dumbledore,"Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs."
hermione,We haven't heard the end of this.
harry,Dumbledore?
harry,I think I've had enough for today.
harry,"Come on, go! Fast!"
dumbledore,"And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime."
harry,Whoa.
harry,Both my parents are dead.
harry,He's asleep!
harry,Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?
harry,Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
harry,I'm invisible??
hermione,Swish and flick!
harry,"You were right, Hermione."
harry,Muggles?
hermione,They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
hermione,"Go, Harry! Go, Harry!"
harry,I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
hermione,"Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!"
harry,"Sorry, no."
harry,I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day at Diagon Alley.
harry,A little.
harry,Expecto... Expecto...Expect...
harry,No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...
harry,I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
harry,"Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?"
harry,Shall we? Wand at the ready.
hermione,Didn't you see what it was standing on?
harry,You've been sacked.
dumbledore,"I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. "
harry,My scar. It keeps burning.
hermione,"Oh, I'm sorry."
harry,I want to go with you.
dumbledore,I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
harry,Come on.
harry,"Ron, maybe I should do it."
harry,Shush!
harry,Lost control of the trolley.
harry,That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. 
hermione,"It's on his suitcase, Ronald."
harry,It's Mrs. Norris.
dumbledore,You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.
harry,Now!
dumbledore,"Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life."
hermione,Never better.
harry,"But who threw it at you, anyway?"
harry,"Oh, no."
hermione,Harry!
harry,Hermione?
harry,Is he all right? 
harry,"Sorry, but what's curious?"
harry,"Wish you were here, Hermione."
hermione,"Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk..."
dumbledore,There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
dumbledore,That is one of my more brilliant ideas. 
harry,Calm down.
harry,We've got loads to tell you.
harry,"It's not true, sir. I swear."
harry,Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron.
harry,"But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
harry,No. Sirius!
snape,Page 394.
harry, It means dangers coming. Uhh!  
harry,"NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. "
dumbledore,"Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. "
hermione,I expect we'll be arriving soon.
hermione,Saving your life.
harry,One minute. 
harry,"We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."""
harry,"I don't know, Sir."
harry,"Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!"
dumbledore,Riddle! Come.
dumbledore,They burst into flame when it is time for them to die...
harry,Hagrid!
harry,Hang on.
dumbledore,Scabbers?
harry,I don't understand.
dumbledore,"No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen."
hermione,"It's a cat, Ronald."
hermione,But I was wrong. 
harry,Don't even think about it.
dumbledore,Aresto momentum!
dumbledore,I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
hermione,Harry!
hermione,We can't be seen.
harry,Who's doing it now?
harry,That's one nasty dementor.
harry,That's odd. 
dumbledore,Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.
dumbledore,She has been Petrified.
harry,Why do you care how I escaped?
harry,We know one thing.
harry,"Forget about it, guys. See you later."
harry,"Hermione, come out."
harry,Strange.
hermione,Thanks.
hermione,She's a little sensitive.
dumbledore,"Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep."
harry,Good to see you too.
harry,"Mind you, she might not have needed saving if you hadn't insulted her."
harry,Justin... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.
harry,Dead. I know.
hermione,Say something.
harry,Expecto Patronum!
hermione,That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!
harry,"If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand."
harry,"B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me."
snape,Well...
dumbledore,Pity you had to see him on a burning day.
harry,That's Pettigrew.
dumbledore,Argus!
hermione,"Good morning, Mr. Weasley."
hermione,Alohomora
dumbledore,"Secure the castle, Mr. Filch."
harry,He'll never be gone. 
harry,Someone's going to try and steal it.
harry,I don’t belong here. 
dumbledore,"Well, search the skies, if you must, minister."
harry,"Give me those, now!"
hermione,the Philosopher's Stone!
hermione,He called me a Mudblood.
harry,Do you think I should have told them?
hermione, It was locked.
harry,"Yes, Uncle Vernon."
harry,I think it's going to kill.
hermione,"Come on, everyone's been so worried."
hermione,Harry!
dumbledore,Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.
harry,It's just a memory.
hermione,"Oh, no."
snape,Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
harry,Get off!
harry,Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
harry,Colin saw it through his camera.
hermione,I...I don't think I'm going.
hermione,It had to be a Gryffindor.
harry,Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.
dumbledore,"Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast."
harry,You made the one on the train go away.
harry,He's put a spell on the harp.
harry,Shut up! Shut up!
dumbledore,"I do, Miss Granger."
harry,"How is it I got the Stone, sir? "
dumbledore,You've been with us all the time.
harry,I gotta tell you something.
harry,You're a fraud.
dumbledore,Over there.
harry,This way.
harry,How long will it take to make?
hermione,"Come on, Harry."
snape,Loss of limb will not excuse you.
harry,Does it seem a bit...quiet to you?
harry,Now what?
snape,"Well, well. Lupin."
hermione,"Clearly, something happened he wants us to change."
harry,She can't even sing.
hermione,What?
harry,But I-I never get mail.
dumbledore,"Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. "
dumbledore,Be careful.
dumbledore,There's been another attack.
harry,Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
harry,I don't care.
harry,"The map was lying, then."
snape,"Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, professor."
harry,Wow!
hermione,Moaning Myrtle.
hermione,Here we come.
harry,No. I think my arm is broken.
snape,I can tell you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper in death.
harry,I see. That's me as well.
harry,My mother's eyes.
snape,And Gryffindors note that five points will be taken from your house for your classmate's cheek.
harry,Peter Pettigrew.
hermione,We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
harry,Your family?
harry,"Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?"
hermione,Just there.
harry,Thank you.
harry,That's a lie.
harry,The dog. Where is it?
harry,Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
harry,"But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?"
harry,What?
harry, I think it's a warning.
harry,I will if she does.
harry,Lumos Maxima...
hermione,Has anyone seen a toad?
harry,"This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
hermione,That looks really painful.
harry,What? Come and live with you?
snape,"However, for those select few who possess the predisposition I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses."
harry,You wrote them.
hermione,You won't make a fool of yourself. 
harry,Could you tell me how to...?
hermione,Now what do we do?
harry,Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
dumbledore,"It is as we feared, Minerva"
snape,We'll have another chat soon...
harry,Keep away from me.
dumbledore,If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
hermione,"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. "
hermione,"Look at you, playing with your cards."
harry,Ron!
harry,I need to know how to fight them.
harry,Where's Hermione?
hermione,Me?
hermione,Ron!!
harry,"One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next..."
snape,Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
harry,Expecto Patronum!
hermione,I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.
dumbledore,Exactly.
hermione,"Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline."
dumbledore,Beg your pardon?
harry,Before I fainted I heard something.
dumbledore,"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry."
harry,Someone I know to be dead.
hermione,Rubbish.
harry,"Dobby, please, no!"
harry,But who...?
harry,"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
hermione,That's right. 
dumbledore,"Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
harry,Was it nice there?
harry,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world.
dumbledore,"Therefore, it is only fitting that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School."
hermione,"That's better, isn't it?"
harry,Can you hear me?
dumbledore,I am well aware of our bylaws having written quite a few of them myself.
harry,HAAGRIIID!
harry,Excuse me.
harry,So you mean this map shows...
harry,No. No.
harry,What are you doing?!
dumbledore,Thank you.
hermione,Much worse.
hermione,"You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?"
snape,You insolent little...
hermione,"Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?"
harry,Anywhere is better than here.
harry,You told me my parents died in a car crash.
dumbledore,"Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured."
harry,It's a broomstick!
harry,I can’t. Hogwarts is my home!
snape,Five points from Gryffindor.
harry,Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me.
harry,Sirius!
hermione,"Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky."
harry,"Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?"
hermione,I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
harry,Rictusempra!
hermione,The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
harry,"You better clear off before my bones come back Dobby, or I might strangle you."
hermione,Very dangerous.
hermione,They're going to suck out his soul.
harry,"This way, now."
snape,"No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle."
hermione,"Bit early for mail, isn't it?"
harry,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron."
harry,Come on.
hermione,That's what makes them so...
hermione,So rude.
hermione,Cheers.
harry,"Excuse me, sir."
harry,But I haven’t had any messages from any of my friends... not one… all summer.
harry,I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.
dumbledore,Let me give you a clue. 
hermione,Did not.
harry,We need to find the train.
harry,Guarding something?
harry,It's his stomachache.
dumbledore,"Good luck, professor."
harry,We got lost.
hermione,I don't know.
harry,What are those?
dumbledore,"When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin."
harry,"It's all right, Ginny."
dumbledore,"Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their family if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
hermione,No. No one ever comes in here.
harry,He just caught fire.
harry,We just don't know why.
harry,"See you, Hedwig."
harry,You're Voldemort.
harry,"But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?"
harry,Excuse me. Excuse me.
dumbledore,"Very well, then. Off you go."
harry,Hang on.
hermione,We'll stay with you too.
harry,It's all upstairs.
harry,I fell over.
hermione,It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
harry,"Oh, nice to meet you."
hermione,Ron. You're okay.
harry,"Yes, sir... See why I’ve got to go back? "
hermione,That's why he's been missing classes.
dumbledore,"Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. "
harry,Th-then you let the troll in.
harry,He was nothing more than a murderer.
harry,Nothing. School stuff
hermione,"Come on. Come on, Buckbeak."
harry,"No, Dobby. Tell me."
hermione,We've got final exams coming up soon.
harry,"There's no such thing, is there?"
dumbledore,"I want it understood, Cornelius that Hagrid has my full confidence."
harry,I'm sure.
dumbledore,If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor then I suggest you look more closely at this.
harry,"Make a wish, Harry."
dumbledore,The truth.
harry,That's us.
dumbledore,"I wonder, could we...?"
harry,Come on.
harry,Thank you.
harry,All right. Hermione?
hermione,What's this all about?
snape,Any theories on how he managed it?
dumbledore,"When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris."
snape,"As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite."
harry,Thank you.
harry,Ripped to pieces?
hermione,Since Professor Snape set the essay.
dumbledore,"Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on."
harry,But someone was screaming.
harry,Sorry?
harry,I just hope I'm wrong.
harry,"Dobby, shh!"
harry,That's the memory I chose.
hermione,You heard what Madam Hooch said.
hermione,Congratulations.
harry,Get off!
hermione,Go away.
harry,"Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. "
harry,"But, Hermione,"
harry,Come on!
harry,Tell me about Peter.
dumbledore,He's far better off growing up away from all of that.
dumbledore,"Three turns should do it, I think."
harry,What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin...
snape,"The term ""werewolf"" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word ""were"" which means ""man,"" and ""wolf."" Werewolf, man-wolf."
hermione,"You okay, Ron?"
harry,Professor McGonagall.
harry,You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.
hermione,"No, Ron, you can't!"
harry,Hold on.
hermione,And we aren't leaving?
harry,"But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again."
harry,Ahh- ahh!
harry,Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
hermione,"Harry, listen to me."
harry,I have a hunch.
harry,He sent the dementors away.
harry,"Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
hermione,"Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now."
hermione,That's awful.
harry,Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?
harry,Maybe we've broken down.
hermione,Me? Books and cleverness? 
hermione,Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
harry,Open it.
harry,Yes?
harry,Do you hear that?
harry,"Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
harry,I don't know.
harry,"Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. "
harry,Expelliarmus!
dumbledore,Not intentionally but yes.
harry,The one with the broken wing!
snape,How disappointing.
harry,Hagrid!
harry,What?
harry,"Hermione, move!"
hermione,Harry!
dumbledore,It means that our students are in great danger.
harry,Let's take him to Hagrid's.
harry,It was my dad.
dumbledore,"Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
harry,I read it on the train that day.
snape,We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.
harry,"Well, you haven't finished it this time."
harry,Not like this.
harry,It's a snake skin.
harry,Don't worry.
dumbledore,It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.
harry,"But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake."
hermione,Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
dumbledore,It's such a very long name...
harry,"Wood, look out!"
harry,"Not directly, at least."
dumbledore,"Before we begin the feast let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified."
harry,Okay.
harry,"Look, we have to ask you something."
harry,Listen.
hermione,It's Snape! 
hermione,Oculus Reparo.
snape,Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
harry,I've never seen spiders act like that.
hermione,Harry!
harry,What's a Mudblood?
harry,He'll He'll come back. 
hermione,"Besides, you don't even know how to fly."
harry,I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
hermione,Didn't.
hermione,I've been here all this time.
snape,"Oh, yes. A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like."
harry,"I thought if you signed it, then I could..."
harry,I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
snape,However the circumstances are suspicious.
harry,At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
hermione,We have to go.
harry,Do you think he's really asleep?
dumbledore,"But remember this, Harry. "
harry,What's going on?
harry,"I mean, more than everyone else?"
hermione,Beautiful day.
harry,"Mummy, Dad, come here! "
dumbledore,"And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. "
harry,You'd like a dragon?
hermione,Let's go.
hermione,Yes.
hermione,He lived a thousand years ago.
harry,My name is Harry Potter.
harry,I'm a what?
harry,Don't panic.
harry,"Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!"
harry,Mrs. Weasley.
hermione,I can't believe you solved it.
harry,There was water on the floor that night.
harry,He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
harry,Come on! Okay. Push! 
harry,"Now, Neville, listen. We were"
hermione,Why are we stopping?
harry,Just talking.
harry,Voldemort?
dumbledore,Look beyond the rocks.
hermione,What an idiot.
harry,"So, then it shows us what we want? "
harry,I know why.
harry,Spooky.
harry,"Hermione, are you okay?"
harry,I didn't do it on purpose.
harry,Let's go.
harry,I saw him across the lake.
harry,Expecto Patronum!
harry,"The vault in question, number 713, had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day."""
harry,I just wasn't quick enough.
harry,Okay.
harry,I did think of Voldemort at first.
hermione,"Harry, you can't."
harry,Just do it.
dumbledore,Good evening.
harry,Your father left this in my possession before he died.
harry,Professor Dumbledore?
snape,"Clearly, it's full of dark magic."
harry,"I'm fine, thank you. I was just going..."
harry,Don't mention it.
harry," He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
harry,I still need... a wand.
harry,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber."
hermione,Fudge is coming.
hermione,Someone with non-magic parents.
harry,"But, what happened to the Stone?"
dumbledore,I didn't really expect him to linger.
harry,"Hermione! Hermione, wait."
harry,Catch the key!
hermione,For example:
hermione,Get off me!
hermione,"Headmaster, you've got to stop them."
harry,"Oh, yeah."
hermione,Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?
harry,Did you hear it?
harry,"Shut up, Malfoy."
harry,Mischief managed. Nox.
harry,My dad wasn't a drunk.
hermione,Leave it to me. 
dumbledore,Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.
harry,He was their friend and he betrayed them.
harry,Ron! Fred. George. 
harry,"There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
dumbledore,They are not.
hermione,And Snape wasn't blinking.
harry,Arania Exumai!
hermione,"Harry, what happened?"
harry,"Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where I might find platform 9 3/4?"
harry,Show me.
harry,Sirius. Come on!
harry,Godric Gryffindor.
harry,Why would I throw something at you?
hermione,Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. 
hermione,Moaning Myrtle.
harry,He was their friend!
harry,One pair of dragon hide gloves.
harry,I think she heard you.
hermione,No. But I don't like flying...!
harry,Okay.
hermione,He's jinxing the broom!
hermione,It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
harry,"You're Aragog, aren't you?"
harry,Anything! 
snape,Vipera Evanesca.
harry,Wingardium Leviosa.
harry,They're my letters!
hermione,"When the smoke turns red, it means you've forgotten something."
harry,"If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means... "
harry,Learnt what?
harry,I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
harry,"Ron, this is it."
harry,Come on! Go!
harry,We'll just go.
harry,How?
dumbledore,"Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?"
harry,You don't expect me to sit here.
snape,Headmaster these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.
hermione,So you're saying...
harry,A month?
harry,That voice.
harry,They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.
harry,I'm not going home. Not really.
snape,What's this?
hermione, What is it?
harry,I know you do.
harry,"No, Not you."
harry,Malfoy?
dumbledore,It lives in your very skin.
harry,Diagonally.
harry,Thanks.
dumbledore,Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
dumbledore,"However, as head of Gryffindor house it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
hermione,Pleasure.
harry,"You see them, don't you? "
harry,No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.
harry,Not as good as you.
harry,But this is important! 
dumbledore,"But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say."
dumbledore,"Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people?"
snape,"There you are, Potter!"
dumbledore,Yes.
hermione,Harry.
hermione,"Yes, and you must!"
dumbledore,"To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. "
harry,"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land none is more deadly than the basilisk."
harry,Muggle?
hermione,I went looking for the troll. 
hermione,"Mandrake, or Mandragora is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state."
snape,Silence.
harry,But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
hermione,I thought I just saw...Never mind.
hermione, Petrificus Totalus.
hermione,Why aren't we leaving?
harry,She should be out of hospital in a few days when she stops coughing up fur balls.
harry," Hagrid, what's that?"
snape,I've done the dungeons.
dumbledore,"Good evening, Hagrid."
harry,Hermione's answered that too.
harry,"That's not good. Ron, run!"
hermione,"Stop moving, both of you. "
harry,This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.
hermione,Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
harry,You're wrong!
hermione,Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
hermione,Mudblood's a foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.
hermione,We can't be there yet.
harry,This is it.
harry, Let's go. Sorry.
harry,And I'll bet one of them fits that door. 
dumbledore,He's been looking dreadful for days.
harry,Everyone?
harry,"But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!"
dumbledore,"I should've known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall."
harry,"Hagrid, what exactly are these things?"
hermione,"No, they can't."
snape,Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.
harry,"Thanks, Hagrid. "
harry,What if I make a fool of myself?
hermione,"Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?"
harry,I-I didn't know.
harry,To You-Know-Who?
harry,I don't know.
hermione,Exactly.
hermione,"Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled!"
hermione,He'll be with his own kind.
hermione,Do you want to move a bit closer?
hermione,Do you think he's all right?
hermione,"It's not funny, Ron."
harry,Trevor.
harry,Stop it!
harry,None of it made any difference.
hermione,"Thanks, Sir Nicholas."
dumbledore,Good night.
harry,Give it here or I'll knock you off your broom!
harry,how do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me?
hermione,Up. Up. Up!
snape,I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
hermione,"Come on, Buckbeak. Come on."
harry,Tell me Dobby when did this happen before?
harry,"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
dumbledore,Off you go.
harry,"Run! Quick, let's hide through that door!"
dumbledore,Everyone except you three.
harry,Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?
harry," We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!"
snape,"Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin."
hermione,"You've got dirt on your nose, by the way."
hermione,Hang on a minute.
dumbledore,"When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
harry,"Well, thank you."
hermione,A fair few.
hermione,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign."
harry,Expelliarmus!
harry,I like this ball.
hermione,Dufftown? That's not far from here.
snape,"Take a look, Lupin."
harry,He's asking me to come live with him.
harry,But I didn't realize...
harry,Come on!
harry,I don't understand. 
hermione,I had you looking in the wrong section! 
hermione,"Harry, no way!"
hermione,With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
snape,"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter."
harry,No.
snape,And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?
hermione,There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.
harry,Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
harry,Voldemort.
harry,"It's just, I've never talked to a snake before."
hermione,"Let's see, then."
hermione,"What's wrong, Harry?"
dumbledore,"Good afternoon, Harry. "
harry,"Don't worry, he will."
hermione,We'd just found him when he said...
hermione,"Harry, listen to me."
harry,And you?
hermione,I've never seen a more complicated potion.
harry,She doesn't know!
harry,Hurry up!
dumbledore,"Am I right, Harry?"
hermione,I thought I just saw… Never mind.
hermione,You have to keep eye contact. 
dumbledore,"As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake."
harry,I have something of yours.
harry,The first time I rode a broom.
hermione,Ugh! What're we going to do? 
harry,But we'll take him to the castle.
dumbledore,"If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss."
dumbledore,"Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required."
hermione,That thing has a name?
harry,So the Sorting Hat was right.
harry,What's he teach?
snape,Should he be warned?
snape,"Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
harry,Why don’t you sit down?
dumbledore,"The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is."
harry,"I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? "
harry,"It's not happy, exactly."
harry,I haven't any money.
harry,"The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults."
dumbledore,"Back again, Harry?"
harry,"Guys, let me go."
harry,Ok– I- understand. You can’t- say.
dumbledore,Thank you.
harry,Wait!
dumbledore,"Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. "
hermione,We're coming out the back door. Go!
hermione,Come on. Everywhere else is full
dumbledore,I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce.
harry,"Yes, sir."
dumbledore,Hagrid is bringing him.
harry,Admirers?
hermione,Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.
hermione,Is it...dead?
hermione,But there might be another way.
harry,"Whooa! Whoa, whoa! "
harry,Ah- um.. Reading.
dumbledore,Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
dumbledore,"We will be able to cure her, Argus."
snape,"As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making."
hermione,Please believe us.
harry,Please wake up.
harry,Lumos.
hermione,"After he saved you, he sent them off."
hermione,"As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe. "
hermione,"The Grim, possibly."
harry,Why can't we get through?
dumbledore,It is our choices.
harry,Ron!
harry,I think she fancies you.
harry,It was my dad conjured the Patronus.
hermione,Get in
harry,Everything.
hermione,Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
hermione,But it's the only plan we've got.
dumbledore,My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.
harry,Maybe if you wrote it down?
harry,Malfoy.
hermione,Sorry.
harry,"It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy."
harry,I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
hermione,"Good. You can help Harry, then. "
hermione,Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
harry,I am.
hermione,What a load of rubbish.
harry,What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
dumbledore,How extraordinary.
harry,He's free. We did it.
harry,Yes.
hermione,There must be another way!
dumbledore,You must not be seen.
snape,They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
harry,"He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day..."
harry,Seems a pity not to ask her.
snape,Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
dumbledore,The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
hermione,Alohomora.
harry,Ron...
hermione,"You! You foul, loathsome,evil little cockroach!"
harry,"What's that you've got, Hagrid?"
harry,"Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?"
harry,It's over.
harry,Hagrid always wanted a dragon. 
hermione,I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion.
harry,"Ron, are you okay?"
harry,Let's go.
hermione,Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
snape,"Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?"
hermione,That felt good.
harry,Hello?
harry,"I think you do, sir."
harry,I should be in Slytherin.
harry,"Get in there, and keep quiet!"
hermione,"What's he talking about, Harry?"
snape,Our new celebrity.
dumbledore,"Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you that the third-floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death."
hermione,Just relax!
harry,"Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
hermione,McGonagall's worried. 
dumbledore,Voldemort.
hermione,"The question is, who is it?"
snape,You have risked the exposure of our world.
dumbledore,"If I'm not mistaken, Harry he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
dumbledore,Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.
harry,Come on! Pull!
harry,"But why am I famous, Hagrid?"
hermione,The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. 
harry,We better take this back.
harry,What are you wearing?
harry,We're friends of Hagrid's.
harry,I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
harry,This says platform 9 3/4.
harry,It's going into the Girl's Bathroom!
harry,It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
harry,How can I speak a language without knowing I can?
harry,But who would choose such a life?
hermione,Where do you suppose this goes?
harry,"Dobby, ssh! I’m sorry! "
harry,"These aren't real frogs, are they?"
hermione,Let's go.
hermione,"The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"
hermione,"Ron's right, Harry. "
harry,"Thanks, Ron."
harry,Oh! 
dumbledore,The only family he has.
harry,We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
hermione,It's forbidden.
harry,Send a message to Dumbledore. 
harry,Thank you.
harry,Ginny?
harry,Sorry.
hermione,You attacked a teacher!
snape,"A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. "
harry,It was Hagrid. 
harry,"Come on, let's get them."
harry,Ahhhhhhhhh!
hermione,Hope you don't mean yourself.
harry,Snape's already been here. 
dumbledore,Good luck...Harry Potter.
harry,I knew the name sound familiar.
hermione,It's just bewitched to look like the night sky.
harry,Yeah.
harry,I'll go on and find Ginny.
hermione,I meant me!
dumbledore,"You know the laws, Miss Granger"
harry,Who are you?
hermione,A werewolf has no choice.
dumbledore,Did what?
hermione,"Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?"
hermione,Muggle-borns.
dumbledore,"But yes, he will die."
harry,Voldemort.
hermione,Just ignore him.
harry,How could a troll get in?
hermione,Now what do we do?
hermione,"Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius."
harry,There! I see it!
harry,"One minute the glass was there and then it was gone, it was like magic."
hermione,You're going to take someone's eye out. 
hermione,"Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! "
hermione,"But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
hermione,It's written in blood.
harry,"Dobby, please stop!"
hermione,Just go. You're wasting time.
harry,Ron! You've really got to see this! 
harry,Yeah. It should be great.
harry,"I don't know, Sir."
hermione,What is that?
hermione,Look. It's Lupin.
dumbledore,They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
harry,I know.
harry,The family you serve is the Malfoys.
harry,No.
harry,Expecto Patronum.
harry,What's this rubbish?
harry,Ron.
dumbledore,"Dear lady, who did this to you?"
harry,He's gone?! Now? 
harry,You liar!
harry,"Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone."
harry,Fortuna Major.
harry,Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
harry,Sirius!
hermione,"Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry."
harry,But who sent it?
harry,Just promise me something.
harry,Your bird...There was nothing I could do.
harry,So this is your master.
harry,Voldemort was after your time.
dumbledore,"No, Harry. I do not think it was you."
harry,Then it'll be you!
snape,A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.
snape,"Remarkable feat, don't you think?"
hermione,"Honestly, Ron, it's not funny."
harry,You first.
harry,I think it’s brilliant
harry,"You were brilliant, Fawkes."
dumbledore,"And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House."
harry,It's too simple.
harry,we almost get killed by a tree...
dumbledore,"I'm afraid so, professor."
harry,You see Sirius talking to me there?
harry,It's Filch's cat.
harry,What happened to me?
harry,I didn't.
harry,Look in properly. Go on. 
harry,Do you miss your family?
harry,And for good reason. 
hermione,Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
harry,Not really.
hermione,I don't like this at all.
hermione,It's in his nature.
harry,But what was that thing you saved me from?
harry,Excellent.
dumbledore,Until he's ready.
harry,"Besides, dead, the truth dies with him."
harry,Expecto Patronum!
harry,Are you all right?
harry,Snape was trying to...save me?
harry,Right there. You'll see.
hermione,Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!
snape,"For your information, Potter"
harry,You're running away?
hermione,Just forget it.
harry,Be thankful it's not your neck.
hermione,Yes 
harry,Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
harry,"No, sir. Nothing"
dumbledore,"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
harry,We'll take the lot.
hermione,With a Patronus.
harry,Go!
snape,There are several ways to become a werewolf.
harry,That hurt.
hermione,Unless it wasn't a student.
hermione,"Honestly, don't you two read? "
harry,Thats my dad
hermione,Happy Christmas.
hermione,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
harry,One of the teachers?
dumbledore,"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. "
harry,But have you seen it?
dumbledore,Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
snape,"I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
hermione,At least someone's enjoying himself.
snape,"Put your hand down, you silly girl!"
harry,Pettigrew escaped.
harry,I mean...l can't be a wizard.
dumbledore,"Argus, I..."
harry,Come on.
dumbledore,"Harry, First, I want to thank you, Harry."
harry,"Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. "
harry,Arania Exumai!
dumbledore,I'd like a cup of tea.
harry,Yes!
harry,You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done.
harry,Exactly.
harry,Now more than ever.
dumbledore,"And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. "
harry,I think we found the train.
harry,Mum? Dad? 
hermione,Whoo-hoo!
harry,"Who was it, then?"
hermione,See you haven't.
dumbledore,"Now, look there."
hermione,Ow! You stood on my foot!
snape,What? Oh!
hermione,"How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?"
harry,We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
harry,What terrible things? 
dumbledore,Is there something you wish to tell me?
hermione,I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
harry,It’s the only place I’ve got friends!
harry,It is time it was returned to you.
hermione," Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this"
hermione,If you're talking about Malfoy...
harry,But what's he got to do with me?
harry,No. Is that really...?
harry,After all you did in your books?
snape,"Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?"
dumbledore,Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
harry,Snoring
hermione,"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another."
harry,That's why I can hear it speak.
hermione,What do you expect?
snape,Why aren't you all copying this down?
hermione,We're tied with Slytherin!
dumbledore,Thank you.
harry,"One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
harry,I’m not allowed to use magic outside of school. 
hermione,Me too.
harry,It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.
hermione,And Snape's coming.
harry,Where's Ron?
harry,"Give it here, Malfoy."
harry,Some kind of...cloak.
harry,No. She deserved what she got.
harry,"Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!"
harry,Let's go this way.
dumbledore,However you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
harry,"Well, I expect they’ve... been- hang on- "
harry,Don't follow until I give you a sign.
snape,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
harry,Do something!
dumbledore,Dementors are vicious creatures.
harry,"It just said, ""Use it well."""
hermione,"Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free."
harry,What?
hermione,Thanks.
hermione,Ronald has lost his rat.
harry,Then you're not the monster?
hermione,Malfoy's coming.
harry,Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign this form.
hermione,"That's why Ron and I went looking for him, professor."
harry,Good punch.
harry,And Hermione had the mirror.
harry,Knight to E-5.
snape,Turn to page 394.
harry,There's a basilisk.
hermione,"If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared."
hermione,It's in your blood.
hermione,"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. 
Enemies of the Heir, beware."
snape,Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow.
harry,Spiders flee before it.
harry,"Besides, if Uncle Vernon…"
harry,Yes.
harry,Sirius.
harry,What?
hermione,Are you okay?
dumbledore,"In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. "
harry,"Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?"
dumbledore,"There, there, Hagrid."
harry,"Come on, Fang."
dumbledore,"The first years, please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students."
snape,I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. Here's the proof.
harry,Norbert?
harry,But you made it go away.
harry,Stop. Hold still!
hermione,That felt good.
snape,Give me a reason. I beg you!
harry,It's true sir. Sirius is innocent.
harry,Still doing that after three years.
dumbledore,But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...
harry,"No, Colin, get out of the way."
hermione,Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
harry,"I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. "
harry,"The monster had killed somebody, Ron."
dumbledore,It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.
harry,No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
harry,Don't worry. I will be.
harry,I spoke a different language?
hermione,Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time Harry.
harry,Why didn't I see it before? 
harry,What would any of us have done?
harry,She only saw the basilisk's reflection.
harry,Just Harry.
hermione,Harry!
harry,Yeah? Try me.
harry,I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.
hermione,Filch is gone.
snape,Reveal your secrets.
harry,You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.
harry,You? No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one
hermione,I hear Draco's father's furious.
harry,And kill me.
harry,Capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.
harry,"Thank you, sir."
harry,We've got to go. We've got to save her.
harry,"Well, I don't know exactly what it means."
harry,"No. Don't worry, okay?"
dumbledore,Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
harry,I'm a what?
dumbledore,"And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. "
harry,No.
harry, Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...
harry,"Earlier, it showed someone in the castle."
harry,Clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
dumbledore,"No, minister. Over this way."
hermione,"Standard book of spells, Chapter 7."
harry,"Clearly, Hermione knows."
dumbledore,"Fascinating creatures, phoenixes."
